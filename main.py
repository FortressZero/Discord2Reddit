# plans
# have bot respond automatically to IMAGES
# have bot determine if image is nsfw, if so, mark it as nsfw. (optional?)
# (optional?) have bot determine if discord OP wants to approve (settings?)
# push to reddit api that makes post

# type of reddit api for future reference: 
# debating between script and web app...
# script will work fine but will not scale too well (but does it have to?)
# web app will scale better since it will allow users to login into their own reddit accs
# for now, I will be developing the reddit api as a SCRIPT but future proof it 
# so it can be turned into a WEB APP later
