# Discord2Reddit
Hello! This is Joshua, with a small program (discord bot) for discord admins to use

The aim of this program is to listen in on messages in a discord channel and 
automatically upload images to a reddit subreddit. The bot guarantees safety of images that are sent
to Reddit since it implements the use of NudeNet to automatically flag images as NSFW. This bot also
communicates with asyncpraw to submit images to Reddit.

As of 1/31/22, the bot is operating under very basic functionality, more features are
to be added soon!
